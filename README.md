# Fullcalendar Library

Wraps [Fullcalendar 5.x](https://fullcalendar.io) as a reusable library.

This module does nothing on its own, you only have to install it, if another
 module requires it.

## Installation

Install this module using the official Backdrop CMS
 [instructions](https://docs.backdropcms.org/documentation/extend-with-modules)

If you want to create your own calendars based on Fullcalendar, you can include
 it with: `backdrop_add_library('fullcalendar_lib', 'fullcalendar')`

## Similar modules

The [Fullcalendar](https://backdropcms.org/project/fullcalendar) module also
 provides the library, but in a legacy version (1.5.x).
